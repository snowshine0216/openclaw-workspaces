A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

Viral
assistant: **Viral** — /ˈvaɪ.rəl/

**English:** Describes something that spreads rapidly from person to person, like a virus. Originally about biological viruses, now mostly used for internet content.

**中文:** 病毒式的；迅速传播的

**Examples:**
- "That cat video went viral overnight." (那个猫视频一夜爆红)
- "The tweet went viral within hours." (那条推文几小时就传开了)

**Synonyms:** trending, popular, viral content = viral hit = 爆款

**Fun fact:** "Viral" used to be purely medical. Around 1994, marketers started using it to describe content that spreads "like a virus" — and the rest is internet history.

**Memory trick:** Think "vibe" + "al" — when content has the right *vibe*, it goes *viral*! 🔥

Prelude
assistant: **Prelude** — /ˈprel.juːd/

**English:** An introductory piece of music, or anything that comes before a larger event (serves as an introduction).

**中文:** 前奏；序曲；序幕

**Examples:**
- "The piano prelude set the mood for the entire concert." (钢琴前奏为整场音乐会定下了基调)
- "The negotiations were just a prelude to the main talks." (谈判只是正式会谈的前奏)

**Synonyms:** introduction, opening, overture, preamble

**Fun fact:** In music, a "prelude" was originally a short piece played before a larger composition. But composers like Chopin and Debussy wrote preludes that stood alone — now they're full works!

**Memory trick:** "Pre-" (before) + "lude" (play) = something played *before* the main show! 🎹

Btw where do u save to?
assistant: Your vocab gets saved to **SQLite database**: `projects/vocabulary/data/vocab.db`

That's the single source of truth — everything lives there. The system also backs it up daily to `vocab.db.bak` and pushes to Git.

Want me to show you what's in there?

  "sender": "ou_ad9b2ccb71d8b5492ddea1e4eaed2be0"
}
```

具体解释一下 You rarely need to squeeze the maximum performance from your hardware, since for every second you gain by optimizing data structures allocations in C, you lose 10x more waiting for network or disk requests to resolve. 后半段 不是很懂
assistant: 整句话的意思是：**你很少需要榨干硬件的全部性能**，因为：

> "for every second you gain by optimizing data structures allocations in C, you lose 10x more waiting for network or disk requests to resolve"

**人话版：**

- 假设你用 C 语言优化数据结构，省了 **1 秒**
- 但你的程序还是得等网络请求或硬盘读写，这些操作要花 **10 倍的时间**（10秒）
- 所以你优化的那 1 秒根本没用——整体还是慢

**核心观点：** 大部分程序的速度瓶颈不在 CPU，而在 **I/O**（输入输出）——网络、磁盘、数据库。相比之下，花时间优化 C 代码纯粹是浪费时间。

**10x more = 10倍更多**

所以后半句在说：省 1 秒 → 浪费 10 秒（等 I/O），亏大了 💀
