snag
assistant: "Snag" is a great little word! Let me break it down for you:

## 📖 **snag** /snæɡ/

**English:** A hidden or unexpected problem; a small difficulty that gets in the way

**中文:** 意外的小障碍；小问题；麻烦

---

### When to Use It

You use "snag" when something *should* be simple, but there's one little thing blocking progress:

- **"We were ready to launch, but hit a snag with the payment system."**
  (We were prepared, but an unexpected problem appeared.)

- **"The plan sounds great. Only snag is, we don't have budget."**
  (Great plan! One small problem though...)

- **"Small snag — I forgot my keys."**
  (Minor issue that complicates things.)

---

### Synonyms

- **hitch** — similar vibe, slightly more informal
- **glitch** — usually technical/mechanical
- **bump in the road** — metaphorical, softer
- **complication** — more formal/serious

---

### Fun Fact

"Snag" originally meant a sharp projection (like a jagged piece of wood). It evolved into "something that catches you unexpectedly" — which is exactly what a snag does to your plans!

---

### Memory Trick 🧠

**SNAG = Something Needing Attention, Grrr**

It's small, annoying, but not a disaster. Just a snag.

nuke
assistant: Oh, "nuke" is a powerful one! 🔥

## 📖 **nuke** /nuːk/ (slang)

**English (verb):** To destroy completely; to delete/remove something entirely; to take extreme action

**中文:** 彻底摧毁；完全删除；采取极端行动

---

### When to Use It

**In tech/coding:**
- **"Just nuke the whole branch and start over."**
  (Delete it completely, we're starting fresh.)

- **"I nuked the database by accident."**
  (I completely destroyed/wiped it.)

**In general conversation:**
- **"The critics nuked that movie."**
  (Destroyed it with bad reviews.)

- **"She nuked her Twitter account."**
  (Deleted it entirely.)

**Literal (rare):**
- **"They threatened to nuke the city."**
  (Attack with nuclear weapons — the original meaning)

---

### Vibe Check

"Nuke" is **informal** and **dramatic**. It implies:
- Total destruction (no half measures)
- Extreme action (often irreversible)
- Sometimes reckless ("I just nuked everything")

Great for casual tech talk. Avoid in formal writing.

---

### Synonyms

- **wipe** — cleaner, less dramatic
- **annihilate** — stronger, more violent
- **obliterate** — total destruction
- **delete** — boring, neutral
- **torch** — similar slang vibe

---

### Fun Fact

"Nuke" comes from "nuclear" (obviously). It started as military slang in the 1950s, then morphed into tech slang in the 1990s — "reinstalling Windows? Just nuke it."

---

### Memory Trick 🧠

**NUKE = No U Keep Everything**

When you nuke something, *nothing* survives.
