**Definition:** To be exactly what you needed or wanted — perfectly satisfying.

**中文：** 正合我意；恰到好处；太爽了

**Pronunciation:** /hɪt ðə spɒt/ — "hit thuh spot" (the "o" is like "hot")

**Examples:**
- "That cold beer really hit the spot after mowing the lawn."
- "This warm soup hits the spot on a rainy day."

**Synonyms:**
- **hit the mark** — more about accuracy than satisfaction
- **do the trick** — gets the job done
- **satisfy the craving** — specifically for food/desires

**Memory trick:** Imagine a dart hitting the bullseye — that perfect "spot" where everything feels just right. 🎯
