[Sun 2026-02-22 02:29 UTC] now whenever i ask a word or phrase, it will give response in idferecent format, the one i prefer is like below: ## Renaissance /ˈren.ə.sɑːns/ 📖 English ** noun**: The Renaissance (historical): The period of European cultural, artistic, and intellectual revival (~14th-17th century), marking the transition from medieval to modern times. renaissance (general): A revival or rebirth of art, culture, or learning. 中文 名词: 文艺复兴（14-17世纪欧洲文化复兴时期） 复兴、再生 🔊 Pronunciation IPA: `/ˈren.ə.sɑːns/` (英式) or `/ˈren.ə.sɑːns/` (美式: REN-uh-sahnss) REN-uh-sahns Tip: Stress "REN" — from French renaître = "to be reborn" Don't say: "re-NAY-sance" ❌ 💬 Examples Historical: "The Renaissance began in Italy in the 14th century." (文艺复兴始于14世纪的意大利) "Leonardo da Vinci was a Renaissance man." (达芬奇是文艺复兴时期的全才) General: "The city is experiencing a renaissance." (这座城市正在经历复兴) "Jazz is having a renaissance." (爵士乐正在复兴) 🔁 Related Terms Renaissance man/woman — 全才，博学多才的人 Revival — 复兴（更通用） Rebirth — 重生（更诗意） Golden age — 黄金时代 🎯 Fun Fact "Renaissance" literally means "rebirth" in French (re- = again, nascere = be born). It marked the end of the "Dark Ages" and sparked innovations in art (Michelangelo, Da Vinci), science (Galileo), and philosophy. The printing press (just learned! 📚) helped spread Renaissance ideas across Europe. 🧠 Memory Trick Think: "RENAISSANCE = RE-NAISSANCE = RE-birth" Naissance = birth (French) Renaissance = born again 🌅 Add to vocab? however it will sometime will give response like: hit the spot Definition: To be exactly what you needed or wanted — perfectly satisfying. 中文： 正合我意；恰到好处；太爽了 Pronunciation: /hɪt ðə spɒt/ — "hit thuh spot" (the "o" is like "hot") Examples: "That cold beer really hit the spot after mowing the lawn." "This warm soup hits the spot on a rainy day." "Your advice really hit the spot — exactly what I needed to hear." Synonyms: hit the mark — more about accuracy than satisfaction do the trick — gets the job done satisfy the craving — specifically for food/desires Memory trick: Imagine a dart hitting the bullseye — that perfect "spot" where everything feels just right. 🎯 Common contexts: Food, drinks, comfort, advice — anything that feels exactly right in the moment. Want me to add this to your vocab for review? i would like 1. each section has sperator line 2. each section the prefixed with emoji do you understand what i mean and how can i force the format to be consistent?
assistant: Now I'll replace the loose guidelines with a strict template:
assistant: Done. Updated AGENTS.md with a **strict template** that enforces:

1. **`---` separator** between every section
2. **Emoji prefix** on every section (📖 🇨🇳 🔊 💬 🔁 🎯 🧠 📝)
3. **Same format every time** — no more freestyling

Want to test it? Throw me a word.
