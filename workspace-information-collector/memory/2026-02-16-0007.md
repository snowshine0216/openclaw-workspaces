Their chat id to sent to?
assistant: The Tavily-based digests target: `oc_55bf80b97398600ff6da478ae62937de`

Retriggering now:
assistant: Gateway keeps timing out. Let me try with a longer timeout:
assistant: Gateway keeps timing out on cron retrigger. This suggests the gateway might be overloaded or stuck. 

**The target chat ID is:** `oc_55bf80b97398600ff6da478ae62937de`

Options:
1. **Restart gateway** — might fix the timeout
2. **Run digest manually** — I can spawn a sub-agent to run the Tavily search now

```

How do u send to this chat which is u use?
assistant: The digests use the `message` tool to send to Feishu. The delivery config looks like:

```json
"delivery": {
  "mode": "announce",
  "channel": "feishu",
