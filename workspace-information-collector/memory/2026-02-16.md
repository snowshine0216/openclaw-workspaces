## 📄 Fresh ArXiv Papers (Feb 12-13, 2026)

### 1. Agentic Test-Time Scaling for WebAgents
- **Authors:** Nicholas Lee et al.
- **arXiv:** [2602.12276](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12276)
- **PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12276.pdf
- **Summary:** CATTS dynamically allocates compute for multi-step agents using vote-derived uncertainty. Improves WebArena-Lite performance by 9.1% over React while using 2.3x fewer tokens.

### 2. CM2: Reinforcement Learning with Checklist Rewards
- **Authors:** Zhen Zhang, Kaiqiang Song et al.
- **arXiv:** [2602.12268](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12268)
- **PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12268.pdf
- **Summary:** RL framework using checklist rewards for multi-turn agentic tool use. Achieves +8-12 points improvement over SFT on tau^-bench, BFCL-V4, and ToolSandbox.

### 3. Think like a Scientist: Physics-guided LLM Agent
- **Authors:** Jianke Yang et al.
- **arXiv:** [2602.12259](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12259)
- **PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12259.pdf
- **Summary:** KeplerAgent coordinates physics-based tools to infer symmetries before equation discovery, achieving substantially higher symbolic accuracy than LLM and traditional baselines.

### 4. UniT: Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Test-time Scaling
- **Authors:** Leon Liangyu Chen, Chelsea Finn et al.
- **arXiv:** [2602.12279](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12279)
- **PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12279.pdf
- **Summary:** Enables unified models to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. Key finding: sequential CoT reasoning more compute-efficient than parallel sampling.

### 5. Scaling Verification for Vision-Language-Action Alignment
- **Authors:** Jacky Kwok, Chelsea Finn, Marco Pavone et al.
- **arXiv:** [2602.12281](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12281)
- **PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12281.pdf
- **Summary:** CoVer verifier yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on SIMPLER benchmark, with 45% improvement in real-world experiments.
