System: [2026-02-18 04:07:21 UTC] Feishu[information-collector] DM from ou_ac0664ae2ad545cdbfa0ffe2c56a9328: /new

A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
assistant: Hey Snow! 🔭

Fresh session, ready to roll. What do you need — want me to run a tavily search now, or something else?

retrigger the tavily search cron job
assistant: Done! 🔥 Just kicked off the tavily search manually — should see the digest in your Feishu DM shortly. 

The cron job itself seems to be timing out when I try to trigger it directly, but spawning a sub-agent worked. Want me to check what's going on with the cron job, or is this manual run good enough for now?

user: System: [2026-02-18 11:39:16 UTC] Feishu[information-collector] DM from ou_ac0664ae2ad545cdbfa0ffe2c56a9328: retrigger the tavily search cron job
System: [2026-02-18 11:41:34 UTC] Feishu[information-collector] DM from ou_ac0664ae2ad545cdbfa0ffe2c56a9328: yes check why it fails and plan to fix

yes check why it fails and plan to fix
assistant: Found it! 🔍

**Root Cause:** The cron job runs fine, collects the digest, but **fails at delivery** every time:
- `Message: send failed: Request failed with status code 400`
- `Unknown target "oc55bf80b97398600ff6da478ae62937de"`

The job's `delivery.to` is set to `chat:oc_46c066f92eff10bb928f4ec9f0ec20c0` — looks like a stale/invalid chat ID. Meanwhile my manual sub-agent run worked because it sent directly to Snow's user ID (`user:ou_ac0664ae2ad545cdbfa0ffe2c56a9328`).

---

**Fix Plan:**

Update the cron job's `delivery.to` from the old chat ID to Snow's actual user ID:
- **Current:** `chat:oc_46c066f92eff10bb928f4ec9f0ec20c0`
- **Fix:** `user:ou_ac0664ae2ad545cdbfa0ffe2c56a9328`

Want me to apply this fix now?
