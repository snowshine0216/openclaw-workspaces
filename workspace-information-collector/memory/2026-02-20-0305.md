A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
assistant: Hey Snow! 🔭

Fresh session, ready to roll. I see you tried to switch to GLM-5 — want me to run with that model, or is there something specific you want to dig into?

## 🔑 Key Highlights

**1. "Software Engineer" Title Disappearing**
Boris Cherny predicts the role evolves to "builder" or "product manager" as coding becomes a default capability. → [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-claude-code-founder-ai-impacts-software-engineer-role-2026-2)

**2. 150% Productivity Boost at Anthropic**
- Engineers are 70-100% AI-coded
- Per-engineer output up **150%** since Claude Code launch

**3. Build for "6 Months from Now" Models**
Don't optimize for today's limitations — what's barely usable now will be native in 6 months. Betting against model progress = technical debt.

**4. Code Shelf Life: Months**
Code from 6 months ago is almost entirely gone. Refactoring isn't exception, it's the norm.

**5. Latent Demand > Education**
Every Claude Code feature came from observing what users were *already doing* — productize existing behavior.

---

## 🎯 Top Actions

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **High** | Review roadmap for scaffolding that next-gen models will make obsolete |
| **High** | Experiment with multi-agent parallel workflows (3-10 sub-agents) |
| **Medium** | Simplify CLAUDE.md — Boris's is only 2 lines |
| **Medium** | Build for what users already do, not what you want them to do |

---

## 💡 Boris's Best Quotes

> *"We are not building products for 'today's model' but for 'models six months from now.'"*

> *"The biggest capability is beginner mindset: being able to admit you're wrong, discard old experience, and think from first principles."*

> *"Build for what models want to do, not what you want them to do."*

That Anthropic autonomy data is fascinating — agents becoming more independent *and* more cautious (asking more questions) is exactly what you'd want to see as they scale. And Gemini 3.1 Pro doubling on ARC-AGI-2? That's a big jump on a benchmark designed to not leak from training data.

assistant: ## 🔗 Link Analysis: "AI Makes You Boring"

### 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Original Ideas Come from Deep Immersion** — The author argues that genuine insights come from spending long time embedded in a problem space — something that doesn't happen when LLMs do the thinking

2. **"Human in the Loop" is Flawed** — Having humans steer AI doesn't make AI think more like humans; it makes human thought drift toward AI output quality (shallow, surface-level)

3. **AI Optimizes for "Correctness" not "Interesting"** — LLMs treat your inputs as genius-level insights regardless of actual quality — they flatten the signal

4. **The Show HN Degradation** — Pre-AI Show HN had projects from people who'd "thought about a problem way longer than you" — now it's flooded with shallow AI-aided projects with nothing interesting to say

5. **Ideation Requires Work** — Ideas get refined through articulation (why we make students write essays). Prompting ≠ articulating. "You don't get build muscle using an excavator."

---

### 📋 Actions to Take

| Priority | Action | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **High** | Protect deep work time | Block time for uninterrupted problem immersion — that's where original ideas come from |
| **High** | Use AI for execution, not ideation | Let AI handle implementation; keep deep thinking for yourself |
| **Medium** | Be skeptical of AI "brainstorming" | If you're stuck, better to go for a walk than ask Claude — incubation > prompting |
| **Medium** | Evaluate your AI usage ratio | Are you offloading thinking or just execution? Track the balance |
| **Low** | Curate information sources harder | Algorithmic feeds reward engagement, not depth — seek long-form |

---

### 🔍 Areas for Deeper Dive

1. **Does AI actually reduce creative output?** — Look at empirical studies on AI-assisted vs. manual creative work
2. **The "incubation" literature in creativity research** — Psychology research on how breaks and immersion drive insights
3. **Prompting vs. writing as thinking** — The difference between externalizing thought vs. having it generated for you
4. **Quality collapse in AI-era content** — Is there measurable degradation in HN, Reddit, etc.?

### 💭 My Take

This is a genuinely thought-provoking piece. The author's core insight — that original ideas emerge from the *work* of deep immersion, not from having an AI summarize or generate — tracks with what we know about creativity research (the "incubation" effect).

The uncomfortable implication: if you offload the thinking to AI, you might ship faster but think shallower. The "human in the loop" is cope — most people calibrate to the AI's output level rather than elevating it.

That said, I think the author slightly overstates the case. There's a difference between:
- **Using AI to execute** (you still do the deep thinking)
- **Using AI to think** (prompting as a replacement for reflection)

The danger is real, but so is the upside. It's about *what* you delegate.
