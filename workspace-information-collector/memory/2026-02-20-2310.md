System: [2026-02-20 23:03:22 UTC] Model switched to sonnet-4.6 (aigocode-claude/claude-sonnet-4.6).
System: [2026-02-20 23:03:49 UTC] Feishu[information-collector] DM from ou_ac0664ae2ad545cdbfa0ffe2c56a9328: Check the GitHub tends cron job to see if it works correctly

}
```

Check the GitHub tends cron job to see if it works correctly
assistant: I'll check the GitHub trending cron job configuration and status.
assistant: Let me check if there's a cron configuration elsewhere or in the workspace:
assistant: **Status:** No GitHub trending cron job is currently configured.

The `github-trending` skill is available in the system skills list (from `~/.agents/skills/`), but:

1. **No cron job exists** — checked `~/.openclaw/agents/information-collector/agent/` and found no `cron.json`
2. **Skill not installed locally** — not in `~/openclaw-workspaces/workspace-information-collector/skills/`
3. **No configuration found** — no references to GitHub trending in workspace files

**To set it up, I need to:**
1. Install the skill locally (symlink or copy)
2. Create a cron job configuration
3. Define schedule + target channel

Want me to set up a GitHub trending daily digest? I can configure it to run at a specific time and deliver to your Feishu DM.

}
```

assistant: Now let me check for the openclaw command properly:
assistant: Perfect! Found it. Now let me check the GitHub trending job specifically:
assistant: Great! Now let me check the actual job configuration:

System: [2026-02-20 23:09:16 UTC] Feishu[information-collector] DM from ou_ac0664ae2ad545cdbfa0ffe2c56a9328: Well I didn’t receive it retrigger it

{
  "message_id": "om_x100b56bad70c04a0c268de937ada7fe",
  "sender": "ou_ac0664ae2ad545cdbfa0ffe2c56a9328"
}
```

Well I didn’t receive it retrigger it
assistant: The job ran successfully just now, but it found **no new content** since the last digest. The deduplication system is working — it checked the state file and determined everything was already sent.

The delivery target is a Feishu **group chat** (`oc_46c066f92eff10bb928f4ec9f0ec20c0`), not your DM. When there's no new content, it sends: "No new GitHub/arXiv updates since last digest. Scout 🔭"

Want me to:
1. Check which Feishu chat that ID corresponds to?
2. Force it to run without deduplication to see fresh results?
3. Change the delivery target to your DM instead?
