user: System: [2026-02-20 23:34:25 UTC] Feishu[information-collector] DM from ou_ac0664ae2ad545cdbfa0ffe2c56a9328: Be more detail for the given link about key takeaways and action to take
System: [2026-02-20 23:50:00 UTC] Feishu[information-collector] DM from ou_ac0664ae2ad545cdbfa0ffe2c56a9328: /new

A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

## 📰 Article: Designing Efficient Agentic AI Workflows

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

**1. Architecture Turns Messy**
- Building one big "do-it-all" agent quickly becomes unmanageable — black box, hard to debug, reuse, or scale. Spaghetti code emerges.

**2. Task vs. Conversation Mismatch**
- LLM systems start as chatbots, but task-based automation requires structure, determinism, and repeatability that chat logic doesn't provide.

**3. Context and Memory Overflow**
- Long sessions or large inputs cause models to lose context or hit token limits → hallucinations, repeating steps.

**4. Performance Trade-offs**
- Deeper reasoning = slower responses. Balancing speed vs. intelligence is brutally hard.

**5. RAG-to-Agent Migration Confusion**
- Evolving RAG → truly agentic system (reason + act) has no clear blueprint. Rewrite? Add planning? Tool integration? Unknown.

**6. Scalability Friction**
- Small-scale success doesn't translate — large files, batch jobs overload context/memory.

**7. Limited Visibility and Control**
- Deployed agents are opaque → hard to understand reasoning or audit decisions. Trust issues.

## ✅ Actions to Take

| Priority | Action | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **High** | Adopt modular agent templates | Avoid monolithic agents — separate reasoning, memory, tools, governance |
| **High** | Define cognitive templates (3 max) | Use RAG Chain, Tool-Calling, ReAct as Lego blocks — compose, don't reinvent |
| **High** | Implement memory hierarchy | Short-term (context) + long-term (vector DB) + summarization for overflow |
| **Medium** | Choose templates by intent | Conversational=low latency, Task=deterministic, Research=reflective |
| **Medium** | Build observability from day 1 | Trace every step: retrieve → reason → act → verify with cost/latency budgets |
| **Medium** | Start RAG → add tool-calling → then reasoning loops | Incremental migration path instead of big bang rewrites |
| **Low** | Use Map–Reduce for large inputs | Chunked processing scales beyond context window limits |

## 🎯 3-5 Areas for Deeper Dive

1. **Agent Architecture Patterns** — Supervisor-Executor vs DAG vs Swarm frameworks for enterprise coordination
2. **Memory Management Systems** — Implementing short-term + long-term memory hierarchies in production
3. **RAG-to-Agent Migration** — Step-by-step upgrade path from retrieval to autonomous reasoning
4. **Observability & Governance** — How to trace agent reasoning and enforce compliance
5. **Multi-Agent Orchestration** — Scaling from single agents to coordinated agent systems
