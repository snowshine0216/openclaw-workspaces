A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

assistant: ## 🔬 AI Agent Testing in Production

### Key Takeaways

- **Testing pyramid for AI agents**: Unit tests → Integration tests → LLM-as-judge evaluations → A/B testing → Production monitoring
- **Mock the LLM**: For unit tests, mock LLM responses to avoid non-determinism, cost, and latency issues
- **Test data categories**: Happy path, edge cases, error cases, and adversarial inputs
- **LLM-as-judge**: Use another LLM to evaluate responses at scale (relevance, accuracy, completeness, clarity, helpfulness)
- **Consistency testing**: Run same query multiple times, measure variance via embedding similarity
- **CI/CD integration**: Automated testing gates with quality thresholds before deployment

### Actions to Take

- **High**: Build test dataset with all 4 categories (happy path, edge, error, adversarial)
- **High**: Implement LLM-as-judge evaluation early — scales better than human eval
- **Medium**: Add consistency testing to catch non-deterministic behavior
- **Medium**: Set up production monitoring with deviation alerts

### Areas for Deeper Dive

1. **LangGraph state management testing patterns**
2. **Specific tools for agent evaluation** (LangSmith, Promptfoo, etc.)
3. **Adversarial prompt injection testing strategies**

## 📖 Article Review: "Your AI Agent Works in Dev. Why Does It Fail in Production?"

**Author:** @v31u (Jan 11, 2026)  
**Length:** 8 min read

### Summary
A practical guide on testing AI agents — from unit tests to production monitoring. Fills a real gap since traditional software testing doesn't apply well to LLM-based systems.

### Strengths
- **Actionable code examples** — mocking LLMs, testing state management, tool selection
- **Comprehensive framework** — covers the full testing pyramid
- **Real metrics** — completion rate, response time, error rate, consistency
- **CI/CD integration** — GitHub Actions pipeline example

### Weaknesses
- Surface-level on **LLM-as-judge** — doesn't dive into prompt engineering for evaluators
- Missing discussion on **cost management** for evaluation at scale
- No mention of **existing tools** (LangSmith, Promptfoo, Helicone)

### Verdict
Solid intermediate resource. Good for teams who've built their first agent and are now hitting the "why does this work in dev?" wall. Not for beginners or advanced practitioners.

**Rating:** 7/10 — Practical but safe. Could go deeper on eval metrics and tooling.

assistant: ## 🔑 Key Takeaways

| # | Insight | Why It Matters |
|---|---------|----------------|
| 1 | **Mock LLMs in unit tests** | Real API calls are slow, costly, and non-deterministic — kills test reliability |
| 2 | **4 categories of test data** — Happy path, edge cases, error cases, adversarial | Covers real-world failure modes |
| 3 | **LLM-as-judge replaces human eval** | Scales evaluation without burning human time |
| 4 | **Consistency testing = embedding similarity** | Detects non-determinism (min_similarity > 0.8 = stable) |
| 5 | **Metrics beyond pass/fail** — completion rate, p95 latency, error rate | Real performance visibility |
| 6 | **A/B test with p-value < 0.05** | Data-driven decisions, not gut feelings |
| 7 | **Production monitoring with deviation alerts** | Catch regressions before users complain |

---

## 🎯 Actionable Next Steps

| Priority | Action | How |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **P0** | Mock LLM in your test suite | Use `unittest.mock.AsyncMock` — article has code snippet |
| **P0** | Build test dataset (4 categories) | Start with 10 cases per category |
| **P1** | Add LLM-as-judge eval | Use GPT-4o with temp=0, score on 5 criteria |
| **P1** | Track metrics (completion_rate, latency) | Implement `AgentMetrics` dataclass |
| **P2** | Set up CI/CD gate | Run eval before deploy, fail if avg score < 0.8 |
| **P2** | A/B test prompts/models | Compare with statistical significance |
