## Conversation Summary

assistant: Let me check the .pi directory which might contain process info:
assistant: Let me check if there's a script that generates the digest:
assistant: Perfect! Now I have the full context. Let me check the actual cron job to see what happened:
assistant: Let me check the sessions_list to see recent activity:
assistant: Based on my investigation, I found the issue. Let me provide Snow with a clear summary:

## 🔍 Investigation Results

I reviewed the cron job history from your memory logs. Here's what I found:

### Issue #1: Missing GitHub Links

**Root cause:** The GitHub trending digest **did include links** in the original output, but they were formatted as plain repo names without full URLs.

Looking at the Feb 21 digest in `memory/2026-02-21-2233.md`:
- The output showed repos like `microsoft/agent-framework`, `google-research/timesfm`, etc.
- But **no clickable `https://github.com/...` URLs** were included

**Why this happened:** The cron job prompt likely asked for concise output, and the agent provided repo names without explicit GitHub URLs.

### Issue #2: Duplicate Messages

**Root cause:** The cron job ran at **22:30 UTC** and delivered to a **Feishu group chat** (`oc_46c066f92eff10bb928f4ec9f0ec20c0`), not your DM.

From the Feb 20 conversation:
- You asked to retrigger the job
- The job ran successfully but found **no new content** (deduplication working)
- When there's no new content, it sends: "No new GitHub/arXiv updates since last digest"

**Possible duplicate scenario:**
1. Job ran automatically at 22:30 UTC
2. You manually retriggered it shortly after
3. Both messages went to the same group chat

### Recommendations

**Fix #1 - Add GitHub Links:**
Update the cron job prompt to explicitly require full GitHub URLs:
```
Format: **repo-name** — description → https://github.com/owner/repo
```

**Fix #2 - Prevent Duplicates:**
- The deduplication system (`last-arxiv-github-state.json`) is working correctly
- Duplicates likely came from manual retrigger + automatic schedule overlap
- Consider adding a cooldown period or checking last-run timestamp before manual triggers

Want me to update the cron job configuration to fix these issues?

yes jysmm
assistant: Got it. Let me fix both issues now.

only fix issue one
assistant: Got it — fixing only Issue #1 (missing GitHub links).

I need to find and update the cron job configuration. Let me locate it:
assistant: I see there's a `trend-watcher` skill! Let me check that:
assistant: Now let me check where the cron job configuration is stored. Let me look at the sessions.json file:
assistant: Let me find the actual cron configuration:
assistant: Perfect! Found it:
assistant: Perfect! Now I can see the issue. The cron job message says "ALWAYS include source links + PDF links" but the GitHub trending part doesn't explicitly require full URLs. Let me update it:
assistant: Done! Updated the cron job configuration to explicitly require full GitHub URLs in the format:

**N. owner/repo** — Brief description → https://github.com/owner/repo

The change adds a specific format requirement for GitHub repos that includes the full URL. Next time the job runs (tomorrow at 22:30 UTC / 6:30 AM GMT+8), it will include clickable GitHub links.
