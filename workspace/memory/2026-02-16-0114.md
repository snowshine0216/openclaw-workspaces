[Sun 2026-02-15 16:08 UTC] read https://docs.openclaw.ai/automation/cron-jobs#cron-jobs very carefully and tell me the diff between 1. delivery.mode: announce (deliver a summary) or none. 2. if mode is announce, can delivery.channel or delivery.to get ommitted?
assistant: Let me fetch the cron-jobs documentation carefully.
assistant: Now I can answer the two questions precisely.

## Answers

### 1. `delivery.mode`: `announce` vs `none`

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **`announce`** | - Delivers the isolated run's output directly to the target channel<br>- Posts a brief summary to the main session<br>- Suppresses messaging tool sends for the run (use `delivery.channel`/`delivery.to` instead) |
| **`none`** | - Internal only - **no delivery to any channel**<br>- **No summary posted to main session**<br>- Job runs silently, output is discarded |

**Key difference:** `announce` sends output somewhere; `none` is completely silent.

---

### 2. Can `delivery.channel` or `delivery.to` be omitted when `mode: "announce"`?

**Yes, they CAN be omitted**, but there's a fallback behavior:

> *"If `delivery.channel` or `delivery.to` is omitted, cron can fall back to the main session's "last route" (the last place the agent replied)."*

However, there's a critical warning:

> *"Missing or invalid delivery targets **fail the job** unless `delivery.bestEffort = true`."*

So:
- **If omitted** → Falls back to "last route" (where the agent last replied)
- **If fallback fails/no last route** → Job **fails** (unless `bestEffort: true`)
- **Safe approach** → Always specify `channel` and `to`, or use `bestEffort: true` as a safety net

---

### Summary

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| `mode: announce` + `channel` + `to` | ✅ Delivers to specified target |
| `mode: announce` + missing `channel`/`to` | ⚠️ Falls back to "last route" - may fail if no last route |
| `mode: announce` + missing + `bestEffort: true` | ✅ Falls back, but won't fail job if target invalid |
| `mode: none` | 🔇 Silent - nothing delivered anywhere |

Show me the unhealthy cron jobs
assistant: Let me check the cron job status to find unhealthy ones.

Hi
assistant: Hi Snow! 👋

Based on the cron job list I just pulled, **all 7 cron jobs are healthy** - every single one shows `lastStatus: "ok"` with `consecutiveErrors: 0`.

No unhealthy jobs right now! 🍀

Was there something specific you wanted to check or fix?
