## Conversation Summary

assistant: Perfect! Let's set up the monorepo with all your workspaces and push to the new repo.

## Step 1: Check what's in /root/openclaw-workspaces
assistant: Great! You already have the structure set up. Let me check the git status:
assistant: Perfect! Now let's add everything, commit, and push:

assistant: You need to create the repository on GitHub first. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Create via GitHub Web (Easiest)

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `openclaw-workspaces` (note: you typed "worksapces" in your message, but I'm using the correct spelling)
3. Make it **Private**
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have content)
5. Click "Create repository"

Then push:
```bash
cd /root/openclaw-workspaces
git push -u origin master
```

## Option 2: I can help you install GitHub CLI
assistant: There's a Tailscale repo issue, but let's check if gh installed anyway:
assistant: Let me fix the apt issue and try again:
assistant: Let me fix the apt issue and try again:
