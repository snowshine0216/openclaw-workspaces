[Sun 2026-02-22 01:39 UTC] show me availabe models under googl-antigravity as I met error: model not allowed: google-antigravity/gemini-3-1-pro-high
assistant: That first grep hit was the Feishu OAuth section, not the models provider. Let me search more specifically:
assistant: Now I see the issue — those model IDs are defined as **aliases** in the `agents` section, but there's no `google-antigravity` **provider** block under `models.providers`. The models are routed through Google's Antigravity OAuth, but the actual model IDs need to exist on that provider.

Let me check if there's a provider definition:
assistant: Here's what's available under **google-antigravity**:

**Configured models (4):**

| Model ID | Alias |
|----------|-------|
| `google-antigravity/claude-opus-4-6-thinking` | `opus-4.6` |
| `google-antigravity/claude-sonnet-4-6-thinking` | `sonnet-4.6-google` |
| `google-antigravity/gemini-3-1-pro-high` | `gemini-3.1` |
| `google-antigravity/gemini-3-1-pro-low` | `gemini-3.1-low` |

**But** — the error `model not allowed: google-antigravity/gemini-3-1-pro-high` means the model ID is registered but the **google-antigravity OAuth provider doesn't actually expose that model**. Looking at the usage info, only these models have quota on the provider:
- `gemini-3-pro-image` (100% left)
- `gemini-2.5-flash` (100% left)

So the model IDs in your config (`gemini-3-1-pro-high`, `gemini-3-1-pro-low`) might not match what Google Antigravity actually offers. The actual available models seem to be `gemini-3-pro-image` and `gemini-2.5-flash`.

Want me to update the config to use the correct model IDs?
